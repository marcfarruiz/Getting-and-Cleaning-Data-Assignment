# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment

This repository contains the code for the final assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. Once the data file is downloaded and unzipped in you computer, download the R source code into your R working directory. Finally, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.

# Data description
The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording. Variables in the subject_ files indicate the subject that has done the activity.

# Code explanation

The code combined training dataset and test dataset, and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

# New dataset

The new generated dataset contains variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for each subject.
